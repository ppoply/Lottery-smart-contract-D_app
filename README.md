# Lottery-smart-contract-react-app
A very basic web app for the lottery smart contract projectdone earlier (https://github.com/ppoply/Lottery-smart-contract)

Info about the project :
- React.js has been used for the user interface just because of its simplicity for development.
- There is only a single component in the whole web-app ie. App.js
- Error handling/input validation has not been done on the react side since this project was just about giving the developer some experience in binding Smart contracts to an actual user interface. (Hence, if any error is thrown on the smart contract side then it will result in crashing the web-app)
- Also for the simplicity for the development it assumed that the web-app's user's have Metamask plugin added to their browser.

<strong> Note : This whole project is part of Udemy's "Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide" course by Stephen Grider.</strong
